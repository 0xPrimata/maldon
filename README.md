# Maldon üßÇ‚õèÔ∏è

Maldon is a CLI for quickly finding salts that create pattern matching Ethereum addresses via CREATE2.
Written in Rust with [Alloy](https://github.com/alloy-rs/core).

Maldon is heavely inspired by [Create2Crunch](https://github.com/0age/create2crunch), with the difference that it supports arbitrary patterns and will exit once it finds a salt.
Create2Crunch is still the better choice if you need GPU support or don't have a predermined pattern in mind.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/maldon.git
cd maldon
# Run it directly
cargo run --release -- <FACTORY> <CALLER> <INIT_CODE_HASH> <PATTERN>

# Add it to your path
cargo install --path .
```

## Usage

```
Usage: maldon --pattern <PATTERN> <FACTORY> <CALLER> <INIT_CODE_HASH>

Arguments:
  <FACTORY>         Address of the CREATE2 Factory contract
  <CALLER>          Address of the contract deployer
  <INIT_CODE_HASH>  Hash of the initialization code

Options:
  -p, --pattern <PATTERN>  Pattern to search for. Must be hex digits only and between 1 and 20 characters
